  caveats <<~EOS
    VoiceBar connects agents to VoiceLayer over /tmp/voicelayer-mcp.sock.

    If setup did not complete during cask install, run:
      voicelayer setup

    To sync voices, vocabulary, and the VoiceLayer daemon secret from another Mac:
      voicelayer update --data-mode direct --data-source <source-host>:/Users/<source-user>
